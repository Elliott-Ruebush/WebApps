    <h1>Assignment 1: Duplicate Me!</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, you are to follow these intructions to duplicate what you see here as a web page. For example, the text above is the 
        largest header you can create using a normal HTML tag. For this assignment, you will only need basic tags, without attributes, so no fancy stuff! 
        Also, everything should be hand coded in a text editor. If I see the telltale junk that web design software puts in then it will not be a satisfactory homework.
    <b><em>This is strong & emphasized text!</em></b></p>
    <h2>OMG this is totally the 2nd biggest header. YES!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Here we have an unordered list</li>
        <li>I suppose I can note at this time that while you should have all the text I have, the font doesn't have to be identical, since it depends on your system</li>
    </ul>
    This haiku uses<br />line breaks to separate the<br />lines. Totally Rad.
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>This</th>   
            <th>is</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>a</th>
            <th>table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>it</th>
            <th>has</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>4</th>
            <th>rows</th>
        </tr>       
    </table>
    <p>Even though there are no lines between cells, the 4 lines above are in a table. Ok! Well that was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...easy?</p>
